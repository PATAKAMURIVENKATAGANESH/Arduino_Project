# Snake Detection System

## Overview

The Snake Detection System is a software application designed to detect the presence of snakes using image recognition techniques. This system is developed to aid in snake detection and prevention, particularly in areas where snake encounters pose a risk to humans or animals.

## Features

- Utilizes image processing techniques to detect snakes in captured images.
- Integrates with an OV7670 camera module for capturing images.
- Implements pattern recognition algorithms to identify snake-like patterns.
- Provides real-time feedback on snake detection status.
- Compatible with Arduino Uno microcontroller board.

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno microcontroller board
- OV7670 camera module
- Arduino IDE for programming
- C programming language knowledge
- Basic understanding of image processing techniques

## Installation

1. Connect the OV7670 camera module to the Arduino Uno board.
2. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3. Download the source code files from the repository.
4. Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided source code.
5. Connect the Arduino Uno board to your computer via USB.
6. Compile and upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.

## Usage

1. Power on the Arduino Uno board.
2. Ensure that the OV7670 camera module is properly connected.
3. Launch the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the system output.
4. Capture images using the OV7670 camera module.
5. Observe the serial monitor for snake detection status updates.
